## Node Server with TypeScript

Node is a run-time environment that makes it possible to write server-side JavaScript. It has gained widespread adoption since its release in 2011. Writing server-side JavaScript can be challenging as a codebase grows due to the nature of the JavaScript language; dynamic and weak typed.

Developers coming to JavaScript from other languages often complain about its lack of strong static typing, but this is where TypeScript comes into the picture, to bridge this gap.

TypeScript is a typed (optional) super-set of JavaScript that can help with building and managing large-scale JavaScript projects. It can be thought of as JavaScript with additional features like strong static typing, compilation, and object oriented programming.
